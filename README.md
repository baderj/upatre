# Upatre Payload Decrypter
Tries to decrypt the payload of Upatre downloads by using the plaintext's size as known plaintext.

Supports the following encryptions:


- decremental XOR
- double decremental XOR
- incremental XOR
- left rotating XOR

Can also decrypt the simplified payload format if the decryption key is known.
